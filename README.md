# Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing the impact of climate change on agricultural production across various regions. Using historical data, the project examines how climate variables such as temperature, rainfall patterns, and extreme weather events affect crop yields, soil quality, and water resources. The analysis utilizes Python libraries and data visualization techniques to present insights into the growing challenges faced by the agricultural sector due to climate change.

# Data Sources:
The dataset used in this project contains key variables like:
Year: The year of observation.
Country/Region: Geographical indicators.
Crop_Type: Type of crop (e.g., corn, wheat).
Average_Temperature_C: Average temperature in degrees Celsius.
Total_Precipitation_mm: Total precipitation in millimeters.
CO2_Emissions_MT: CO2 emissions in megatons.
Crop_Yield_MT_per_HA: Crop yield in metric tons per hectare.
Extreme_Weather_Events: Number of extreme weather events recorded.
Economic_Impact_Million_USD: Economic impact in millions of USD.
Preprocessing Steps:
Missing Values: Missing data was handled by imputation where possible, using mean or median values, or by removing rows with excessive missing information.
Data Type Conversion: Categorical variables like Country and Crop_Type were encoded, while numerical variables were formatted correctly for analysis.
Outlier Detection: Extreme outliers were examined to differentiate between legitimate climate-related events and data entry errors.
Normalization: Variables on different scales (e.g., pesticide use and fertilizer use) were normalized to allow for comparison during analysis.
Time-Series Formatting: The Year column was converted to a time-series format to track changes over time, enabling trend analysis.

# Installation and Requirements:
To run the analysis and visualizations, you'll need the following Python libraries: 
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
numpy
scikit-learn (optional for advanced analysis)
Install these libraries using pip:

## Data Loading: The dataset is loaded using pandas. Ensure the CSV file is in the correct location or modify the file path accordingly in the script.
python
Preprocessing: The preprocessing steps outlined in the project are applied to clean and prepare the data for analysis. This includes handling missing values, detecting outliers, and normalizing relevant variables.

## Analysis: Various analyses can be performed on the dataset, such as:

Trend analysis of crop yield over time.
Correlation between climate variables and crop yields.
Comparative analysis of regional and crop-specific climate impacts.
Visualization: Visualizations like line charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps are created using matplotlib and seaborn to present the data insights.
